        <p>I have been coding since 2019. My first language was <span style="color: red;">JavaScript</span>, it was to code a Discord bot for moderation and miscellaneous. I learnt how to use Node.js and started making website for my bot. To further extend my knowledge, I started inetgrating a different purpose website and integrate it with my bot, which can access the website utilities and perform functions DIRECTLY from discord using <span style="color: red;">Discord API</span>.</p>
        <p>After that, I started to learn <span style="color: red;">Adnavced Python</span> & <span style="color: red;">C</span> from university. My focus then switched to <span style="color: red;">Unreal Engine</span>, to make a custom made character to further advance my AI as a 3D model. I got to know about Unreal Editor and Metahumans and how to animate in basic level but I have kept that part of my concept on hold.</p>
        <p>As time goes on, I learned various techniques on how to protect & manage web applications, and learnt to use MongoDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL for backend.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I tried to use <span style="color: red;">Kali Linux</span> Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), I started to do more basic operations on the terminal rather than using graphical user interfaces. With the time I used Kali Linux, I learnt more about the system, including kernels, boot loaders, windows manager and the ability to solve problems myself.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I used more <span style="color: red;">Node.js</span> features to increase the level of privacy and security feature in my websites and backend applications.</p>
        <p>Apart from that, I also went into more low level by learning to code in <span style="color: red;">C</span>. By learning C, I am able to understand how memory is managed and how to use pointers to access memory, along with how basic functions are performed behind the scene of high level languages.</p>
